## NLP
For NLP tasks, we are relying on Hugging Face's transformers library and Happy Transformer, an API built on top of the former.

### NLP Notebooks
To make input poems usable by Happy Transformer, we need to format them and put them together in a text file. You can use the [inputs generator nb](notebooks/txt_inputs_generator.ipynb) for this task; its options are explained inside.
